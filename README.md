CRM Software with Django

The project is accessible at http://167.99.82.115:8000/

This is a simple demo customer management software. 

There are two types of accounts. User accounts and Admin accounts. 
User accounts can only do the following: 
1. View their information
2. Change their personal details such as name, email, phone number and profile picture.


Admin accounts on the other hand can
1. View
2. Add users
3. Delete users
4. Edit user details
5. View orders
6. Create orders
7. Edit orders

To login, please create an account in the login page

For demo purposes, I have created an admin account. You can log in using 
user: admin
password: Kenya2023
